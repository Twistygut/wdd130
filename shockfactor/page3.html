      <h3>Magpies and Crows - The Birds Have An Economy???</h3>
      <p>
        Magpies and crows are hyper-intelligent birds at least as far as non
        primates go. They have demonstrated that they can understand the concept
        of exchange. This has become so relevant, that people in nyc have gotten
        into trouble for exchanging “shiny things” for money. Hilarious.

      <h3>Talking Dog - bark bark… bark???</h3>
      <p>
        A remarkable dog named Bunny has captured the internet's attention. This
        clever canine has learned to communicate with her humans using a
        specialized button board. By pressing buttons with symbols representing
        words, Bunny can express her desires, needs, and emotions.
