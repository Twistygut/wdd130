      <h3>Arctic Geese - Base Jumping Nightmare.</h3>
      <p>
        Arctic Geese are born on tall pillars of rock suspended above the
        ground. Having just been born, they cannot fly, and must use rather
        brutal tactics to get to their food source which lies hundreds of feet
        below.

      <h3>Carpenter Ants - It’s Alive!!!</h3>
      <p>
        A particular fungal infection drives Carpenter Ants to find a suitable
        environment to spread the infection further. Once an infected specimen
        has reached a specific altitude on a plant, it will bite down and cling
        onto its surface and wait for the next stage of the infection to
        commence. The next stage involves the fungal infection flowering from
        the head of the ant, causing more spores to be released, starting the
        cycle once more.

      <h3>Turritopsis dohrnii - Gods Among The Mortals.</h3>
      <p>
        Turritopsis dohrnii is a species of biologically immortal jellyfish!
        They are a carnivorous species that mostly consume zooplankton. They are
        Biologically Immortal, however in practice this doesn’t mean they live
        forever. They usually die from disease or predators, which mostly
        consists of other jellyfish.

      <h3>Whales - Exploding Carcass… EWW</h3>
      <p>
        A large build up of gasses can occur during the decomposition process of
        whale carcasses, and if left undisturbed can build up enough pressure to
        have explosive results. As hilarious and disgusting as it is, it
        actually can become a liability if they are beached when this happens.
        Because of this, people usually try to.. uh… “burst” them in controlled
        environments. This leads to a variety of absolutely stellar youtube
        videos that aren’t for the light hearted.

      <h3>Vampire Bats - Let me in?</h3>
      <p>
        Vampire bats are fascinating creatures with a unique feeding strategy
        that sets them apart from other mammals. As the only mammals that
        exclusively feed on blood, they have evolved specialized adaptations to
        support this lifestyle. Their saliva contents is one example. Their
        saliva contains a powerful anticoagulant, preventing blood from clotting
        and ensuring a steady flow. Terrifying. They literally evolved to be the
        ultimate vampire.
