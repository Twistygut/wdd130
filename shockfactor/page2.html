    <h1>Animal Behavior Facts</h1>
    <p>ur mom</p>
    <p>
      The animal kingdom is filled with a variety of interesting animals each
      with their own unique behavior. The tactics used to survive can be quiet
      shocking.

        <h3>Arctic Geese - Base Jumping Nightmare.</h3>
        <p>
          Arctic Geese are born on tall pillars of rock suspended above the
          ground. Having just been born, they cannot fly, and must use rather
          brutal tactics to get to their food source which lies hundreds of feet
          below.

        <h3>Carpenter Ants - It’s Alive!!!</h3>
        <p>
          A particular fungal infection drives Carpenter Ants to find a suitable
          environment to spread the infection further. Once an infected specimen
          has reached a specific altitude on a plant, it will bite down and
          cling onto its surface and wait for the next stage of the infection to
          commence. The next stage involves the fungal infection flowering from
          the head of the ant, causing more spores to be released, starting the
          cycle once more.

        <h3>Turritopsis dohrnii - Gods Among The Mortals.</h3>
        <p>
          Turritopsis dohrnii is a species of biologically immortal jellyfish!
          They are a carnivorous species that mostly consume zooplankton. They
          are Biologically Immortal, however in practice this doesn’t mean they
          live forever. They usually die from disease or predators, which mostly
          consists of other jellyfish.

        <h3>Whales - Exploding Carcass… EWW</h3>
        <p>
          A large build up of gasses can occur during the decomposition process
          of whale carcasses, and if left undisturbed can build up enough
          pressure to have explosive results. As hilarious and disgusting as it
          is, it actually can become a liability if they are beached when this
          happens. Because of this, people usually try to.. uh… “burst” them in
          controlled environments. This leads to a variety of absolutely stellar
          youtube videos that aren’t for the light hearted.

        <h3>Vampire Bats - Let me in?</h3>
        <p>
          Vampire bats are fascinating creatures with a unique feeding strategy
          that sets them apart from other mammals. As the only mammals that
          exclusively feed on blood, they have evolved specialized adaptations
          to support this lifestyle. Their saliva contents is one example. Their
          saliva contains a powerful anticoagulant, preventing blood from
          clotting and ensuring a steady flow. Terrifying. They literally
          evolved to be the ultimate vampire.
