      <p>
        People will visit my site to refresh their minds. People will visit my
        site to satisfy their sense of absurdity, to be entertained. People will
        visit my site to understand more about the world, to educate themselves
        on a new level.

      <h3>
        What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Ideally, I would have it so that I can directly link documentaries, and
        other educational videos to my website so that people can experience the
        content first hand, rather than summarizing it through text.

      <h3>
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this
        information or complete the actions?
      </h3>
      <p>
        People will use my site to complete actions because it is a streamlined,
        stylized, and easy way to access really absurd and shocking animal
        behavior facts.
